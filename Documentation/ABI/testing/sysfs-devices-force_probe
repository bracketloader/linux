What:		/sys/devices/.../force_probe
Date:		August 2016
Contact:	Matthew Garrett <mjg59@srcf.ucam.org>
Description:
		The /sys/devices/.../force_probe attribute is
		present for all devices. If deferred probing is globally
		enabled and the device has no driver bound, a write to this
		node will trigger probing. This attribute reads as 1 if the
		device currently has a driver bound, and 0 otherwise.
